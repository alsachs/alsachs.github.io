 <h1>Owning a Dog 101!!</h1>

 <h2>rylee</h2>

    <p>My credibility in this site is I own a year old mini Australian shepherd named Rylee. She is a merl blue who doesnt stop smiling. Rylee likes all people, animals and tons of treats. Her favorite treat is BegginStrips. </p>

    <p>Rylee requires a ton of exercise and socialization She has her own Instagram so all her friends can follow her at all times!.:<a href "target"="_blank" > https://www.instagram.com/cantguardrylee/?hl=en</a></p>
